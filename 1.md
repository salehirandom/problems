# Click Counter

Write a pure Python HTTP server that counts the number of clicks.

### **Details:**

The HTTP server receives a `GET` request to the `/` endpoint and stores this information somewhere. There may be more
than 1 request per second (1 req/s), and you should handle concurrent requests.

Return the HTTP response as the following, and replace the `#` with the actual request number:

```txt
request number #
```
